# Semi-functioned-Visual-Inspection-Machine
This is the Ai AI-empowered visual inspection machine project. In which the deep learning algorithms like object detection and autoencoders are used with advanced python frame works are used  to find out the defects on manufacturing parts at a speed of 400 parts a minutes on production.
